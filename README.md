# Welcome to Whiskers
v0.9 Alpha February, 2013

A better way to post online.

## What Is Whiskers?

Whiskers brings tailored communication across social networks without the burden of duplicated effort, and ensures you always have unmediated access to the content you share.

## Cross-post Like a Human

Every social network is different, and that's how it should be. But when you try to share the same message in different places it can come out feeling awkward. Whiskers fixes that with a posting interface that lets you start from a single message and tweak it for each network, making every message a perfect fit.

## Own Your Content

Online services often say that you own your content. While it's true that you own what you make, they actually own the copy that everyone sees. What's more, the terms of service can restrict what you can do with your content after you've posted it.

Whiskers re-balances that ownership by acting as the point of origin for your posts and archiving as you go, so you always have the authoritative copy of your work.

## Own Your Platform

Whiskers server is open-source and self-hosted. While it takes a little more work, Whiskers is not another black-box service, run by and another company, that you have to rely upon.

You can also customize and adapt Whiskers to suit your needs and workflow. And, your fixes or extensions you decide to contribute back will earn you open source gold stars of love.

## Great! How Do I Start Using It Right Now?

Whiskers is currently under research and devleopment and is currently a usuable alpha, which cross-posts to Twitter, Facebook, and App.net. We're still figuring out what the next iteration will be, and invite you to be part of that discussion.
